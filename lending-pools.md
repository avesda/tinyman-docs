# Lending Pools

Lending Pools are designed to enhance the potential of your assets by integrating the mechanisms of DEXs and Lending platforms.

### Features of Tinyman Lending Pools:

* **Dual Yield**: Enjoy the benefits of accruing yield from both Folks Finance's lending protocol and Tinyman's liquidity pools simultaneously, e.g. Earn interest on ALGO and USDC deposits through Folks Finance.
* **DEX Pools**: Our pools are uniquely composed of interest-bearing assets, amplifying the utility of your deposits. Receive swap fees from the liquidity provided in the Tinyman DEX pool.
* **Asset Utilization**: With Tinyman's Lending Pools, your assets work harder, ensuring higher capital efficiency.

This synergy results in deeper liquidity, an increased Total Value Locked (TVL), and amplified yields.

### Getting Started with Tinyman Lending Pools:

1. Visit Tinyman UI – [Lending Pools ](https://app.tinyman.org/#/pool/all-pools?onlyVerified=true\&onlyLending=true)
2. Select the Lending Pool that you want to invest in.&#x20;
3. Click “Add Liquidity” to choose the amount for providing liquidity.

5. So you can participate in the Lending Protocol and Pools with just one click and earn dual yields!

### Special Note on Lending Assets in Tinyman Lending Pools:

When participating in Tinyman's Lending Pools, it's important to be aware of the specific assets used for lending purposes. These assets typically have names beginning with "f-", signifying their function as Folks Finance integrated assets. For example:

* **fALGO**: Represents ALGO deposited in Folks Finance, used for earning interest in lending pools.
* **fwBTC**: Represents wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) in the Folks Finance lending ecosystem.

These "f-" prefixed assets are central to the operation of Lending Pools, allowing users to seamlessly earn interest on their deposits through Folks Finance, while simultaneously participating in liquidity pools on Tinyman.\
