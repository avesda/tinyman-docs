# Permissioned Methods

The protocol includes a number of permissioned methods. These are methods that can only be called by specific addresses. In this section we describe what these methods can and cannot do.

{% content-ref url="roles.md" %}
[roles.md](roles.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="methods.md" %}
[methods.md](methods.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="related-non-permissioned-methods.md" %}
[related-non-permissioned-methods.md](related-non-permissioned-methods.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
